# Project Name: LinkedIn Job Postings

## Overview
Welcome to the LinkedIn Job Posting Analysis project! This repository contains code and documentation for analyzing a dataset featuring over 15,000 job listings from 2023, providing insights into current hiring trends and skills required. This repository contains files related to our database systems such as SQL and NoSQL.The dataset uses SQL solution in MySQL and AWS, offering a valuable resource for job seekers and recruiters. Also, NoSQL solution utilizing MongoDB for efficient data storage, retrieval and Visulaizations.The project involves data preprocessing, SQL/MQL queries, and performance testing using JMeter(SQL) and Compass(NoSQL). A detailed pdf reports for both SQL and NoSQL implemetaion is also available.

## File Structure for SQLSolution
